## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors identify the initial and concluding positions within a string or line. For instance, the ^ symbol can be utilized to locate the start of a string, while $ can be employed to find the conclusion of a string. For example, if you wanted to match all words that start with “a”, you could use the following regex: ^a\w+

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers lets you determine the number of times a character or group of characters should be found. For example, you can employ the asterisk(*) to locate zero or more instances of the character or character class just before it.or the plus sign(+) to locate pme or more instances.

### OR Operator
The OR operator | is used to match either of two patterns. For example, Mac|PC would match either "Mac" or "PC. The | symbols allows you to specify alternatives

### Character Classes
Character classes lets you match specific types of characters. For instance, you can use \d to match any digit (0-9)

### Flags
A set of instructions that modify the behavior of a regex. These flags give you the power to tweak how the regex works. For example, you can make it ignore uppercase or lowercase differences (case-insensitive), or enable it to find matches across multiple lines.

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping is used tp apply quantifiers or other operators to multiple characters. Capturing captures part or all of a match into a group. For example, Parentheses () create capturing groups.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character ranges, allow you to define a set of characters to match within a specific range. For example,{A-Za-z 0-9] matches any alphanumeric character.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
By default, quantifies are greedy. They try to match as many as they can. Use *?, +?, ?? for lazy matching

### Boundaries
Boundaries assist in pinpointing the exact locations where patterns should match within the context of words. For example, \b matches word boundaries

### Back-references
Back-references are a technique in regex that lets you use content you've already found in the same pattern. For example, you can use \1, \2 to refer to captured groups.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions in regex let you match a group only if it comes right before or after another specific pattern, but without actually including that other pattern in the final result. For example, (?=abc) is a positive look-ahead (matches if followed by "abc") and (?<=abc) is a positive look-behind (matches if preceded by "abc"
